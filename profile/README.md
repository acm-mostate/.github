## Hi there 👋 We are ACM at Missouri State University

Join us for our weekly meetings every Tuesday & Thursday from 2 to 4 pm at CHK 210 for our programming training session.

More to come in the next days! 🤓🥳🎉

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
